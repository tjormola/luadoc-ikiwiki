# IkiWiki doclet for LuaDoc

This is a doclet for [LuaDoc](http://luadoc.luaforge.net) that writes
wiki pages for [IkiWiki](http://ikiwiki.info) wiki compiler software
from Lua source files documented with [LuaDoc markup](http://luadoc.luaforge.net/manual.html#howto).
Wiki pages are written as [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
files.
